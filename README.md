# Superstore Sales Analysis (Tableau Dashboard)

This repository contains my work for **Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling** as part of the Data Analyst Internship program.  
The goal was to analyze the Superstore dataset using Tableau and create a dashboard that tells a compelling business story.
## Dataset
- File: `superstore.csv`
- Records: ~9,800 rows
- Time Period: 2015 ‚Äì 2018
- Key fields: Order Date, Region, State, Category, Sub-Category, Segment, Sales
## Objectives
- Explore and analyze Superstore sales data
- Build meaningful visualizations in Tableau
- Focus on data storytelling and business insights
## Visualizations & Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard includes:
1. Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart)
2. Sales by Category & Sub-Category (Bar Chart)
3. Top 10 States by Sales (Horizontal Bar Chart)
4. Sales by Region (Map)
5. Sales by Customer Segment (Pie/Bar)

‚û°Ô∏è Screenshots of the Tableau dashboard are available in the `screenshots/` folder.
## Key Insights
- Total Sales: **$2.26M (2015‚Äì2018)**
- Best Category: **Technology ($827k)**
- Best Region: **West ($710k)**
- Top State: **California ($446k)**
- Consumer Segment contributes the most (~50.7% of sales)

üìå Business takeaway: Focus marketing and inventory on Technology products in the West region, especially California. Target Consumer segment for promotions.
